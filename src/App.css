/* Potential CSS Things To Do:
    Scale nav font so it looks a lot larger on desktop view, currently the text and icons both look rather small.

    Increase Viewport Height for Image Banner container - 25vh looks great. I wonder if I can do that responsively, we'll see.

    Another thing apparent to me is that there isn't much space between the event banner's bottom and the search bar. I wonder if I can have an increased
    margin bottom when the site is used by larger devices.

    Are No Results Found, Match Finder, etc. not centered?!?

    ....Do I need something to explain the site's structure for those who are unfamiliar with GBVS and how it works?
    This is a question for the webdev discord.
        Maybe a little About button?
            Adding an About button or a How To Use button somewhere on the main page of my site because I imagine that it'd be hard for people who don't have the context of my site's purpose to figure out how to utilize it. 

    Search Results should be aligned below search bar, Search bar take up less horizontal space and should be larger.

    Maybe image banner doesn't have to be so much horizontal sapce too?

    Search Results & Click Results:

    I'm thinking that maybe when a search result is clicked, the following should happen:
    
    Search Bar Content changes to tag name - for example me is replaced with Metera.
    Search Result section becomes hidden until user types in Search Bar again.
    Click Result content is displayed.

    Click Results Formatting:
    Character images, names, icon, VS, and Event Name should scale, they look wayyyy too small on desktop.
    Event Name should be lined up with the tip edge of search bar, the content is too far out.
    
    That's good enough for now imo.


    Scaling from mobile to desktop:
    Use media queries
*/

/* Media query for desktops */
@media (min-width: 992px){
    /* Scaling nav text for desktop */
    .navLink {
        font-size: 2.0em;
    }
    #imgHeadContainer {
        height: 28vh;
    }
}


/* 
    I think that I'm going to have to approach
    scaling the icon in a manner that's rather difficult.
    This is going to be done by using componentDidMount alongside state.
    On component mount, I'm gonna have to get screen width then from there I have to
    scale accordingly w/ a state variable

    This is kinda the basic premise of how you'd accomplish that.

    The code for this has been written! Mess with like actual screen resolutions sometime later.
    Think I might have to write a ternary for it.

    4% margin bottom?
